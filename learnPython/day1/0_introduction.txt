About python :
developed in late 80's by Guido Van Rossum
named after a show which had a character named python
it is hybrid language: i.e have both compiler and interpreter
is extensible language
    can be used with other languages
    have different flavours i.e n number of compilers
used in data science, web development, software development, game development, cloud, image processing,
    compilers, and in IOT

have 2 versions : python2 and python3 (they are totally different)
    eg. print is keyword in python2 and print() is function in python3

why study python3
    backward compatible to python2
    1.4 lakh libraries present

    .py             --> compiler        --> Intermediate        -->  Interpreter        --> output
    source code                              code

different compilers in python
    pypy --> python
    cpython --> c
    iron python --> dot net
    jpython --> java
